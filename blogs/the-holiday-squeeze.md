The holiday season in Kerala, known for its vibrant festivals, scenic landscapes, and rich cultural heritage, is a magnet for travelers from around the globe. However, as demand for travel soars during festival seasons like diwali,onam,christmas and others, so do ticket prices, creating a significant impact on tourists and locals alike. These ticket prices affect the Keralites who are out of the state for studies or jobs at different parts of the country.A survey conducted on travellers sheds light on how migrants perceive these price hikes, how they adapt to the changes, and what measures they believe can be taken to tackle the issue.

According to this survey, 89% of respondents noticed moderate ticket price increases during the holiday season. Around 44.9% reported a rise of 10-25%, while 35.7% observed a more substantial hike of 25-50%. A smaller segment, 13.3%, noted minimal increases of less than 10%, and only 5.1% experienced hikes exceeding 50%. These figures highlight a pattern of rising costs that causes the financial strain on travellers.

This surge in ticket prices can be attributed to supply and demand. During Kerala’s peak holiday season, which coincides with major festivals like Onam and Christmas, there is a  rush of domestic and international tourists often exceeding the available travel options. Travel modes like Airlines and bus operators adjust their pricing strategies to attain maximum profit from the heightened demand, leaving travelers with limited affordable choices.

## Effects on Tourist Behavior and Choices

The price hikes significantly influence migrant behavior, as revealed in the survey. Nearly half of the respondents (48.3%) stated they adjust their budgets to accommodate the increased costs. For many, this means cutting back on other travel expenses, such as accommodation,food or other leisure activities to ensure their trip remains within budget.

Another 40.7% reported seeking alternate travel options, such as shifting from flights to trains or buses, or exploring budget-friendly alternatives. This trend underscores the growing importance of affordable travel options in the tourism sector.

However, for a smaller yet notable group (11%), the price hikes are hindrances, leading them to avoid traveling altogether. This highlights the potential negative impact of rising costs on Kerala’s tourism industry, as it may  alienate budget-conscious travelers who may choose other destinations that can be traveled at lower prices.

## Traveler Adaptation and Suggestions

The survey also explored respondent’s opinion on measures that could help address the issue of ticket price hikes during the holiday season. It includes:

1. **Early Booking Discounts:** A significant 41.5% of respondents believe offering discounts for early bookings could reduce the burden of high ticket prices. This approach motivates the  travellers to plan their trips in advance, allowing operators to manage demand that results in providing the customers with tickets at an affordable rate. 

2. **Government Regulation:** About 32.2% of participants feel that government regulation is necessary to regulate ticket pricing during peak seasons. Policies such as setting a maximum limit on ticket prices, providing subsidies, or promoting budget-friendly travel options could ensure greater accessibility for all travelers.

3. **Encouraging Off-Season Travel:** Another 21.2% suggest promoting off-peak travel as a solution. By promoting travel during less busy periods, Kerala’s tourism sector could achieve a more balanced distribution of visitors throughout the year, reducing the strain on resources and stabilizing ticket prices.

4. **Other Measures:** A smaller group (4%) proposed alternative measures, including better transparency in ticket pricing and collaboration between travel operators to maintain fair pricing standards.

Ticket price hikes significantly affect migrants traveling to Kerala, especially during holidays and festivals. Many Non-Resident Keralites (NRKs) return home during peak seasons, but rising travel costs make it difficult for them to visit frequently. This decline in migrant travel impacts Kerala’s tourism industry, as NRKs contribute to local businesses, hotels, and cultural tourism. Reduced visits mean fewer economic benefits for the hospitality sector. Additionally, fewer NRKs bringing family and friends to explore Kerala leads to a decline in tourist footfall. Addressing ticket price hikes is crucial to sustaining Kerala’s tourism and ensuring continued economic growth.

By implementing targeted measures such as early booking discounts, promoting off-peak travel, and bringing government regulation, Kerala can strike a balance between maximizing tourism revenue and ensuring affordability for travelers. These steps will not only enhance the travel experience but also reinforce Kerala’s position as a welcoming and inclusive destination.

As the state continues to grow as a global tourism hotspot, addressing the impact of ticket price hikes during the holiday season will be pivotal in maintaining its charm and accessibility for all. By listening to travelers and adapting to their needs, Kerala can ensure its holiday season remains a time of celebration for everyone.
