Will he be ever kissed?

Will he be ever hugged?

Will he be ever fed?

No, no,noâ€¦

Because he is a stray being,

Will he be ever blessed,

With the sweetness of joy?

Or would be left alone,

In the dark bitter world?

The smell and baby were fresh ,

But not the pain,

With a heavy downpouring heart,

I stepped out,

The mother in me,

Longed to go back at his cries,

But the societal woman in me was refrained,

His shadow brightened 

And cries loudened,

As the waves approached closer.
