The hair flew free,

Without the pain of the husting pull

The lips saw the dark lipstick

With a dazzling smile,

That was someday thrown on the ditches,

The eyes were elegantly kajaled,

Without the traces of the flowing tears 

The nails that were stained,

With the horrors of an insolent relationship

Were elated to see the red polish,

The saris that cried of the sorrows

Of a rotten relationship,

Looked astounding fresh,

She was MUKHTA,

The woman in red,

Gorgeous and bright

As the rising sun,

Hopeful and dreamy like the rising star,

Suddenly the woman disappeared,

Like the sun trapped between the clouds,

The joyful Mukhta was wetted,

With the tears from a similar face,

With the difference of 

A heavy ring and the flowing red along 

The parting line that ....,

Never made her MUKHTA !!!
