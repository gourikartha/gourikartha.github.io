The one that gave me 

Blooming flowers ,

That cheered me up ,

The leaves that danced

Danced with my toddle ,

The strong bole that 

Played with and hugged me ,

The dark grandma

 Who watched my games ,

The fruit that fed me ,

And there she stood 

Watching me grow and grow 

But once she became old and weak ,

She could no longer

Cheer me up and ,

Nor could dance with me ,

The hands that fed me 

Was weak and old 

And then ….

The hands that fed me 

Were chopped off ,

The leaves that danced with joy ,

Screamed of sorrow ,


The bole that hugged me ,

Fell off 

The delicious food

Was tasteless ,

Because she was burning

 under it !!!

I ran out to say her 

Of the dream ,

But the scene just tore me off !!!

All I saw was a deadly emptiness !!!

And I knew it wasn’t 

Merely a dream !!!
