I gently opened the doors to my peace,

Lighted ,the beautifully colourful candles

With the best aroma,

That melted away all the stress of the day.

Spreading all over, the sweet smelling oil

That made me smell yummy like the butterly cupcakes,

Slowly, I stepped in to the tranquilzing warm water,

Decorated with the petals of rose.

The foam in the tub,melted away all the dirt from the skin,

And the soothing smell cleansed me within.

My eyelashes touched each other,as I enjoyed my favourite experience.

The music played softly as I seeped down with passion.
