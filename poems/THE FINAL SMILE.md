Her exciting stories that never finished remained unsaid,

The books with the poems that made

her a hopeless romantic,

Remained open,

Like a fresh memory.

The letters still waited for her beloved,

With the warmth of her love.

The dreams seemed left back, 

In the corners of her diary.

The places she wished to visit, 

Remained unvisited.

She looked like a well of love that never dried up.

Everything seemed cold in front of her smile,

The final smile she had behind a candle.
