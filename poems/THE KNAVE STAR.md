The star that smiled

To lit the dark

The one I love,

The beauty that peeped 

Through the window,

To witness the soft kisses,

Overhear the million little dreams we murmured,

Hear the songs we hummed,

The unending love we shared,

But little beauty ,

I never knew you were knave,

Till the day you stole him away,

To keep with you,

In a world I could never touch,never feel,

Not waiting for a final goodbye,

You took him away,

To laugh at me when I weeped wet !
