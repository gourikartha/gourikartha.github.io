Give me back, the colourful balloons,

I swear , I wouldn’t ask for a bigger teddy.

Give me back,the grandma tales,

I swear , I wouldn’t ask for a fairytale.

Give me back, the campus life,

I swear , I wouldn’t ask for better days.

Give me back, my love,

I swear , I wouldn’t ask for a better soulmate.

Give me back, my family,

I swear , I wouldn’t ask for a better heaven.

Give me back, my kids,

I swear , I wouldn’t ask for a better gift.

Give me back, my health,

I swear , I wouldn’t ask for a better body.

Give me back, my time,

I swear , I would never ask for a better life.

But the sand had already filled the glass.
