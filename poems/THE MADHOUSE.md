The baffling pain that

took me there ,

The cage of a million souls

Killed by the surmise of 

The civilizations,

The iron bars were death

Not cure,

The ominous walls wiped

The concealed tears,

I was stifling in the heat

Of the cries,

The high level insulin

Inoculated in me,

To expel the demon,

Made me a living dead,

After years of the horrors,

With fresh dreams 

I stepped out ,

To see the colours once

Constricted from me

But i wasn't  welcomed

With colours,

Because the board read

‘THE MADHOUSE’.
