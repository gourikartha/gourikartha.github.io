The cry of a little soul that dreamed of,

Cheerful swings with the chirpy little bangles,

Momma’s gentle hands along the hair strands,

Ears full of grandma stories,

Sweet toddles along the courtyard,

That marked the tinkles of the little anklets

Eyes filled with joy from,

The beautifully blooming flowers,

Were never heard by the 

Approaching curettes

That snipped the little heart,

Crushing the little dreams mercilessly,

The little heart that wished to sleep,

In layettes with momma’s warmth,

Coiled cold in the laps of clod in black!
