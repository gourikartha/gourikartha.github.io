Legs soaked in the imprinting sand,

Waves dancing through my little ankle bells,

The little breeze that drifted me to,

The beautiful pair of eyes that I love gazing at,

Slowly gliding my palms onto the strong pair that held me strong,

Falling into the day,

My legs slowly touched his,

To reach his alluring lips trying ,

To gift a fervent kiss,

Only to unitedly fall at once,

To drench together,laughing.

We fell back from the sweet moments,

With a little cry,

Only to see our little bairn whine,

Over the ice cream man passing.
