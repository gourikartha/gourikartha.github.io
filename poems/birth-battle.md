A sudden twirl of darkness rolled my eyes   

As the lights dimmed,

The people in blue became vague,

The sharp needles pierced  through my veins

That blurred my memories,

But still I could trace the sharp curette

Piercing my abdomen mercilessly,

I was growing pale of the blood that oozed,

And sweated beneath my life saving mask,

But I still held on to the hands that promised my infinity,

The lethal battle continued for another hour,

Till it paused with the arrival of a little piece of flesh,

Tinted in white and covered in blood but,

The images blurred to drip into darkness.

Slowly I rolled my eyeballs still wet with the tears,

To see the image I waited for the past nine months,

With trembling hands i held the little piece of flesh,

That now forged the figure of a human.

The shrieking cry brought in a beam of smile in me,

The smile of a warrior on the verge of victory.

I twinkled on to the trembling lens

In the hands that carved my name,

Trying to capture the moment that is

Treasured forever in my heart.  

<!-- ## Reflection

I wrote this haiku series during a walk through the forest near my childhood home. The autumn has always been a time of introspection for me, a reminder that change is not only inevitable but beautiful. The trees don't resist shedding their leavesâ€”they embrace the cycle, knowing that renewal awaits.

In our busy lives, we often resist endings, cling to what was. But nature teaches us that there is grace in letting go, wisdom in embracing the changing seasons of our lives. Each fallen leaf is not a loss but a preparation for new growth.

As I collected a few vibrant maple leaves to press between the pages of my journal, I was reminded that impermanence itself creates beauty. The brilliant colors of autumn exist precisely because they are fleeting.  -->
