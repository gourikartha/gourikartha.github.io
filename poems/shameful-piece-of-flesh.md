Why am I a shame to you?

An object of pleasure?

Why am I a shame to you?

To be hidden from sight like a shameful piece of flesh.

How did I become a piece of pleasure?

When she decided to decorate her flesh.

How did she become a slut?

Only when she decided to decorate me the way she loved.

Why am I a shame to you? 

When one you were the one who called me divine.

Why should I be tortured and covered?

Just in fear of your heinous eyes?

No.Im not a piece of shame but pride.

You are the one to be dishonoured

To carry your intoxicated eyes.

I am no shame to be hidden,But

Beauty to be decorated, the way she love.

Keep your grisly thoughts away from me coz

Not you nor them its just she who decides how

She decorate her piece of flesh.

<!-- ## Notes

I wrote this on a particularly stormy afternoon, when the rain was coming down in sheets. There's something about rainy days that inspires introspection - perhaps it's the natural boundary they create between us and the outside world, giving us permission to turn inward and simply be.  -->
